# EnchantLimiter — Changelog

Unreleased — per-player exemption
## Summary
- The limit can now be lifted for individual players instead of the whole server.

## Added
- Per-player exemption, stored per world (`data/enchantlimiter_exemptions.dat`), not in the config.
- Config `general.exempt advancements`: earning any listed advancement exempts the player
  (also applied on login for advancements earned earlier).
- Command `/enchantlimiter exempt <players> [true|false]` (op level 2, works for offline players).
- Optional FTB Teams support: if anyone in a player's party is exempt, the whole party is.
  Checked live, so joining an exempt party grants it and leaving revokes it.
- Exempt players see "Enchant Points: No limit" in tooltips; anvil previews match the server.

## How it works
- The limit is only lifted for operations a player performs: enchanting via any table that uses the
  vanilla menu-button packet (vanilla, Apotheosis, Enchanting Infuser, ...), the anvil, and the
  Apotheosis Library. Loot, villager trades and commands stay limited.
- `/enchantlimiter enable|disable` still toggles the mod for everyone.

Release: 3.0.2 — 2026-01-19

## Summary
This release introduces four crystal items that modify enchantment point capacity, tightens and fixes anvil/enchantment behavior (including partial application of enchanted books to avoid exceeding enchantment-point caps), stabilizes mixins and event handling, introduces shaped recipes for crystals, and improves tooltip and creative tab behavior. The goal is predictable, robust handling of enchantment points and clearer UX.

## Highlights
- New Crystal items: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary (+1 / +3 / +5 / +10 enchantment points).
- Anvil behavior: enchanted books are now partially applied when only limited capacity remains (the rest is discarded).
- New custom creative tab (Enchantment Table icon) with crystal items visible.
- Tooltip improvements: enchant points visible only on relevant items (swords, tools, armor, shield, bow, crossbow, trident).

## Added
- Items
  - `enchantlimiter:common_crystal` — +1 enchantment point, stack 64
  - `enchantlimiter:uncommon_crystal` — +3 enchantment points, stack 64
  - `enchantlimiter:rare_crystal` — +5 enchantment points, stack 64
  - `enchantlimiter:legendary_crystal` — +10 enchantment points, stack 64
- Config
  - New `crystals` section in server TOML: enable toggle, values per crystal, crystal blacklist.

## Fixed
- Amboss accepted unlimited books and allowed over-cap stacking — fixed by:
  - `AnvilEnchantHandler`: trims book-added levels to remaining capacity (partial application).
  - `EnchantmentHelperMixin`: ensures final writes respect caps.
  - `ItemStackMixin`: prevents direct `enchant(...)` calls from writing levels that exceed capacity.
- Tooltip shown on all items — fixed to show only for relevant item types.

## Removed
- Problematic or incorrect Mixin injections that caused build/mapping errors; functionality replaced/covered by event handlers and `EnchantmentHelper` overwrite.

## Application
Partial book application:
    - Sword 0/20 + Book(cost 20) ⇒ applies fully.
    - Sword 0/20 + Book(cost 30) ⇒ result is trimmed to fit 20; extra levels lost.
    - Sword 19/20 + Book(Unbreaking V) ⇒ only 1 point applied (e.g. Unbreaking I).
